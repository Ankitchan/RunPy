Run Python scripts without installing Python environment on Windows

Hey coders!!! Below is a new method to run python scripts through command prompt without installing Python environment on windows platform

Steps:

1. Download latest version of Python zip folder from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and extract it to your local machine.
2. Download Pip from https://github.com/pypa/pip. Extract and copy the pip folder to Python folder, extracted in the above step.
3. If you need to install any external modules then run the following on command prompt:
    python.exe -m pip install <module name(s)>

Voila!!! You can run your Python scripts as:
python.exe <yourscriptname>.py

Note:
I have included a Python folder for your reference which you can reuse it for your own purpose.
